Thank you very much, Mr. @Klinteen for your comment.
Yes, it's a pleasure for me. I created a div and I put within it an img(equilibrium.jpg)
<div class="image">
  <img src="images/equilibrium.jpg"
</div>
After that, I began to style these elements
first I gave to div.image
.image {
  position: relative
}
because i will use ::before and ::after pseudo-elements for the cyan color background and eye image
Then I began to style eye image:
.image::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;   // These for move image in div workflow
    top: 50%;                                               //
    left: 50%;                                               //those are centering image
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);     //
    width: 48px;
    height: 48px;
    background-image: url(images/icon-view.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;   //the value of this property by default is repeat
    z-index: 1;                           // 1 because the image is in ::before pseudo-element
    display: none;                   //  for hover (when I used hover, I changed display )
}
After that, I began to style the cyan background:
.image::after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 310px;  // here I had a problem I don't know what it made it, but I fix it 
                                   Manual (before I wrote 100% but a 5px added to the cyan 
                                   background)
    background-color: var(--Primary-Cyan);
    opacity: 0.5;
    border-radius: 10px;
    display: none;
    transition: var(--main-transition);
}
Finally 
.image:hover::before,
.image:hover::after {
    display: block;
}
I hope this explanation is understandable, Because I'm in learning process of English
